# Hotel-Management-System

In my project “Hotel Management System” I have tried to show how the
data/information in hotels is managed. This is just an overview of management in hotels.
It manages and maintains the records of customers, rooms, employees and drivers in the
hotel. The project is aimed to maintain the day-to-day state of admission/vacation of
Residents, List of employees, room details etc. Main objective of this project is to
provide a solution for hotels to manage most their work using computerized processes.
This software application will help admin to handle customer information, room
allocation details, Payment details etc.
The rooms have different categories like single bed, double bed etc. so their charges and
records will be maintained accordingly.
This software has been made in a user friendly interface, so that anyone can add, delete,
update the entries and handle all the transactions easily. As a security I have provided
Admin username and Password.
